According to the confusion matrix we can see that 1 and 8 are the most confused digits. While zero is easiest to predict because all the actual labels are predicted correctly.

**Principle componenet Analysis**

PCA plot is ploted across highest variance so that we can cover more information of the image in the specified component. The graph shows that what is the proportion of two components in 9 digits. It also shows that each digit is how much related to each other.
