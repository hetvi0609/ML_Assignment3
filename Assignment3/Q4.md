**Time Complexity**

Dimensions of matrix:-
Input:-n*d
theta:-d*c

*Training*

For multiplication it takes O(ndc) and this is for 1 iteration hence for i iterations it is O(indc)

*Prediction*

For multiplication it takes O(ndc) so for prediction it is it is O(ndc)

**Space complexity**

Space complexity is O(nd+dc)
